# Binary Clock

I created a simple binary clock with an Arduino Uno, 16 LEDs (with resistors) and three 74HC595 shift registers. The frame was made with some wood and a piece of laser cut acrylic. This is what it looks like https://imgur.com/a/xZAHo.

The code is an adaptation of code I came across in John Boxall's Arduino Workshop.

The clock.svg file was created in Inkscape at the behest of the company that performed the laser cutting for me.

The wooden frame was made by cutting a channel in a long plank with a router and then bevel cutting two pieces with a mitre/chop saw, and finally gluing them perpendicular. Having only two sides to the frame implies that the frame itself is also binary (for me anyway).

I also made a watch-sized version, please see other folder in the arduino-projects repo.
