# Twitter Post Notifier

I attached a makeshift (i.e. bodged together with paper clips, blu-tack and a lolly stick) switch to my letterbox which was then
connected to an Arduino with the wifi shield attached. The switch is triggered when the letter flap opens, and when this happens the
Arduino (using OAuth) sends a tweet from a specially-created account to let followers know that post had been received.

A video of the gadget in operation can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtkqKkeI3qg
