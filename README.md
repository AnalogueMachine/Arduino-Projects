# Binary Clock

I created a simple binary clock with an Arduino Uno, 16 LEDs and three shift registers. Buttons were added to allow changing the hours and minutes (require debouncing). The frame was made with some wood and a piece of laser cut acrylic. This is what it looks like https://imgur.com/a/xZAHo.

The clock.svg file was created in Inkscape at the behest of the company that performed the laser cutting for me.

The wooden frame was made by cutting a channel in a long plank with a router and then bevel cutting two pieces with a mitre/chop saw, and finally gluing them perpendicular.
